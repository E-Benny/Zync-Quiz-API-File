# Zync Hathways Coding Assessment
This compressed file contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files needed to run the app designed by Zync.

## Installation
The product uses vanilla JavaScript and doesn't need and NPM or Yarn install to run. Simply open up the HTML file in your browser to run the app.

## Project Status
The project runs fine. However, I encountered a few problems that prevented the project from running as efficiently as possible.

The button function only displays the grades for the students in the first array. I tried to have it iterate through all the arrays in the API, but I wasnâ€™t able to do so.

The search function for the students worked fine when I tested it out on CodePen (front-end development website), however, when I wrote the same code on Visual Studio Code, the JavaScript function didn't work out and I ran out of time to completely fix the problem.

## Roadmap
One of the ways I would go about this problem next time is to find the best way to understand how to make functions work for all the respective arrays in a given API.

Also, I would try to figure out better ways to test for JavaScript functions to make sure that they are compatible across numerous media.
